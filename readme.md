This is the project of group 03. 

The main `index.html` file includes jQuery, Popper.js and JavaScript Code from Bootstrap. Also the Bootstrap CSS file is loaded.

You can start working by copying the index.html rename it to your desire. Try to use the Bootstrap components as they describe it in the great [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).
